# TC1030

Joaqu√≠n Badillo

This repository contains the source code for the projects done in the TC1030 course: Object Oriented Programming.

The final project for this course is called Streaming, which is a simple model for a Streaming Service implemented using the Object Oriented Paradigm. As a sidenote, the class was imparted in Spanish and even though I translated almost everything to English, the last project is still written in Spanish. Moreover, I decided not to push many class diagrams and reports as they were also written in Spanish.
